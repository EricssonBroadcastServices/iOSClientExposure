/// Analytics dispatch consists of several subcomponents each responsible for a distinct task.
/// The core system consists of a realtime delivery engine which optimizes the networking process for minimal usage and maximum responsiveness. This is achived by batching the events in a pipe.
///
/// A second subsystem watches for delivery response errors and maintains a retry queue. Once the dispatcher recieves an error message, as a server response or a networking issue, the current batch is marked for retry. 
/// This process is active as long as the `dispatcher` is alive.
///
/// Once the `dispatcher` reaches the end of it's lifecycle, the `termination` procedure activates. This subsytem will handle any unsent data by either dispatch or, failing that, storing the events to disk. Persisted events are delivered as soon another `dispatcher` is instantiated.
